# Stowy-Unity-Tools

My tools for unity.
Allows to : 

- Install my default packages automatically
- Install some packages (input system, post processing) faster than with the package manager
- Create the default file structure I use for new projects
- Create the `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files

## How to install

In the Package Manager, click the "+" on the top left and click "Add package from git URL...".
Then paste the following line of code in the text box.

```
https://github.com/St0wy/Stowy-Unity-Tools.git
```

## How to use

Everything is accessible from the `Tools/Setups` menu in the toolbar at the top (should be on the left to `Window`).
